This is a compiler. It compiles a very c++-like language that I refer to as c3.

It has no particular goals, and is really just a fun project I like to work on every now and then.

In its current state it can compile functioning programs for os x (See program.c3 for a program that exercises random features and prints meaningless junk to stdout.). The feature set is too limited to really use for anything serious, but maybe soon I'll be able to use it for my personal side-projects.
